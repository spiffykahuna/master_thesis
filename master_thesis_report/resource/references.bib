abstract={The wave glider is a new autonomous marine vehicle that is unique in its ability to harness ocean wave energy for platform propulsion. This paper provides an overview of the wave glider vehicle's architecture and capabilities, and presents results from the extensive engineering sea trials that we have conducted with several prototype and the current production generations of the vehicle. The vehicle's performance in a variety of ocean conditions is described. The vehicle's robustness and capabilities for extended mission durations are also examined. The vehicle's autonomous control architecture is explained, as are the Web-based interfaces for external control and monitoring of the platform. Finally, we discuss several payload packages that have been or are currently being developed for the vehicle.},

abstract={Wave Glider is a combination sea-surface and underwater vehicle comprised of a submerged "glider" that is attached to a surface float via a flexible tether. Fig. 1 shows the Wave Glider. It is propelled by the conversion of ocean wave energy into forward thrust, independent of wave direction. The wave energy propulsion system is purely mechanical; no electrical power is generated by the propulsion mechanism. Just as an airplane's forward motion through the air allows its wings to create an upward lifting force, the submerged glider's vertical motion through the comparatively still waters at the glider's depth allows its wings to convert a portion of this upward motion into a forward propulsion force. As waves pass by on the surface, the submerged glider acts as a tug pulling the surface float along a predetermined course and is controlled by a single rudder on the glider. Separation of the glider by 23 ft (7m) depth from the float is a crucial aspect of the vehicle design. Fig. 2 shows the operating principles.},

abstract={The wave glider is a new autonomous surface platform with unique capabilities for persistent observation in a variety of marine environments. The applications of this novel technology continue to expand; some of the potential oceano-graphic applications will require precise positioning and navigation beyond the platforms current capabilities. In this article we discuss the potential for precise localization of a wave glider based on a augmenting the onboard instrumentation (adding a high quality global positioning receiver and inertial measure unit) and implementing an estimation algorithm (an extended Kalman filter using a two-body dynamic model). To understand the capabilities and limitations of the wave glider's novel propulsion mechanism, consisting of a surface float and submerged glider to harvest wave energy for forward motion, we propose a simplified dynamic model appropriate for real-time implementation. The physical parameters of this model are identified using experimental measurements collected from a wave glider operating in a coastal environment. Finally, we present the results of a proof-of-concept field experiment where the wave glider at the surface was used to precisely position a instrument moored to the seafloor to evaluate the performance of the wave glider for the type of mission that requires precise navigation.},

    abstract = {{The Web services Conceptual Architecture describes IBM's approach to Web services in terms of components, interactions, standards, and infrastructure. This white paper first defines the essential characteristics of Web services and the artifacts, roles, operations, and lifecycle of the Web services model. The paper next discusses the Web services stack and its relevant standards (SOAP, WSDL, UDDI, and so on) in depth. The paper then summarizes the extensions required for this basic Web services architecture to be viable for e-business applications. Among the extensions discussed are security, quality of service, and management, as well as support for context, conversations, activities, intermediaries, and portals. Finally, the paper examines the role of Web services in the context of business processes and work flows. The architecture presented in this document includes high-level descriptions of the components and functions required for Web services, as well as requirements for tooling and middleware that will implement these components and functions.}},
