The vehicle's performance in a variety of ocean conditions is described. The vehicle's robustness and capabilities for extended mission durations are also examined.

abstract={Wave Glider is a combination sea-surface and underwater vehicle comprised of a submerged "glider" that is attached to a surface float via a flexible tether. Fig. 1 shows the Wave Glider. It is propelled by the conversion of ocean wave energy into forward thrust, independent of wave direction. The wave energy propulsion system is purely mechanical; no electrical power is generated by the propulsion mechanism. Just as an airplane's forward motion through the air allows its wings to create an upward lifting force, the submerged glider's vertical motion through the comparatively still waters at the glider's depth allows its wings to convert a portion of this upward motion into a forward propulsion force. As waves pass by on the surface, the submerged glider acts as a tug pulling the surface float along a predetermined course and is controlled by a single rudder on the glider. Separation of the glider by 23 ft (7m) depth from the float is a crucial aspect of the vehicle design. Fig. 2 shows the operating principles.},

abstract={The wave glider is a new autonomous surface platform with unique capabilities for persistent observation in a variety of marine environments. The applications of this novel technology continue to expand; some of the potential oceano-graphic applications will require precise positioning and navigation beyond the platforms current capabilities. In this article we discuss the potential for precise localization of a wave glider based on a augmenting the onboard instrumentation (adding a high quality global positioning receiver and inertial measure unit) and implementing an estimation algorithm (an extended Kalman filter using a two-body dynamic model). To understand the capabilities and limitations of the wave glider's novel propulsion mechanism, consisting of a surface float and submerged glider to harvest wave energy for forward motion, we propose a simplified dynamic model appropriate for real-time implementation. The physical parameters of this model are identified using experimental measurements collected from a wave glider operating in a coastal environment. Finally, we present the results of a proof-of-concept field experiment where the wave glider at the surface was used to precisely position a instrument moored to the seafloor to evaluate the performance of the wave glider for the type of mission that requires precise navigation.},

This white paper first defines the essential characteristics of Web services and the artifacts, roles, operations, and lifecycle of the Web services model. The paper next discusses the Web services stack and its relevant standards (SOAP, WSDL, UDDI, and so on) in depth. The paper then summarizes the extensions required for this basic Web services architecture to be viable for e-business applications. Among the extensions discussed are security, quality of service, and management, as well as support for context, conversations, activities, intermediaries, and portals. Finally, the paper examines the role of Web services in the context of business processes and work flows. The architecture presented in this document includes high-level descriptions of the components and functions required for Web services, as well as requirements for tooling and middleware that will implement these components and functions.}},

@phdthesis{Fielding2000,
  abstract = {The World Wide Web has succeeded in large part because its software architecture has been designed to meet the needs of an Internet-scale distributed hypermedia system. The Web has been iteratively developed over the past ten years through a series of modifications to the standards that define its architecture. In order to identify those aspects of the Web that needed improvement and avoid undesirable modifications, a model for the modern Web architecture was needed to guide its design, definition, and deployment. Software architecture research investigates methods for determining how best to partition a system, how components identify and communicate with each other, how information is communicated, how elements of a system can evolve independently, and how all of the above can be described using formal and informal notations. My work is motivated by the desire to understand and evaluate the architectural design of network-based application software through principled use of architectural constraints, thereby obtaining the functional, performance, and social properties desired of an architecture. An architectural style is a named, coordinated set of architectural constraints. This dissertation defines a framework for understanding software architecture via architectural styles and demonstrates how styles can be used to guide the architectural design of network-based application software. A survey of architectural styles for network-based applications is used to classify styles according to the architectural properties they induce on an architecture for distributed hypermedia. I then introduce the Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural style and describe how REST has been used to guide the design and development of the architecture for the modern Web. REST emphasizes scalability of component interactions, generality of interfaces, independent deployment of components, and intermediary components to reduce interaction latency, enforce security, and encapsulate legacy systems. I describe the software engineering principles guiding REST and the interaction constraints chosen to retain those principles, contrasting them to the constraints of other architectural styles. Finally, I describe the lessons learned from applying REST to the design of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol and Uniform Resource Identifier standards, and from their subsequent deployment in Web client and server software.},
