Current work introduces conceptual approaches for implementing an extensible
service oriented client-server application on a small microcontroller.
This is a general-purpose transport and hardware independent embedded server
that uses remote procedure calls as primary communication protocol.
This server looks like remote service that could provide defined functions to
the client.

This paper has a research about available service oriented architecture technologies and reviews them in the context of embedded resource constrained hardware systems.

There is also an implementation of a small embedded service and corresponding client.
Service part is implemented on STM32F1 family ARM Cortex-M3 microcontroller and runs FreeRTOS operating system.
Client part is realized as Java library RPC stub and Android demo application.

Client and server are communicating using lightweight JSON-RPC protocol over Bluetooth wireless communication line.
Some few RPC call functions are implemented to show the capabilities of such client-server architecture.
