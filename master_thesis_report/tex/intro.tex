This is a test of acronyms  \gls{ASIC} \\

This is a test of code listings
\begin{listing}[H]

At first here will be lots of words about this cruel world and how it was
changed in resent years.

Speech about reusable components.

Speech about small mobile devices that are everywhere.



Communication.

Interaction.





Computers are very essential in our life. Computer is an electronic device
used in almost every field. It is very accurate, fast and can accomplish
many tasks easily. In early days computers were only used by the government
and army to solve different high computational tasks. After invention of
low-cost microprocessors, computers became available to every person. Nowadays  
there are billions of personal computers and they are almost at every home. In
addition to that there are systems, called embedded systems, that are
implemented for a particular purpose.
Every home has several examples of embedded computers.
Any appliance that has a digital clock, for instance, has a small embedded microcontroller that performs no other task than to display the clock.
Modern cars have embedded computers onboard that control such things as ignition timing and anti-lock brakes using input from a number of different sensors.
